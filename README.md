This is just a basic program that decrypts ".nin" files from the MMORPG Nin Online.

Works only on Windows. Sorry, I don't even know how I did this.

Firstly it opens a new window where you must select the file or files that you want.
After that, it opens a new window where you can select where to export the images from those .nin files.

(.nin files are inside "C:\...\Nin Online\data files\graphics")

(If you play from Steam you can open the Nin Online directory Right-Clicking: Nin Online > Properties > Local Files > Explore...)
